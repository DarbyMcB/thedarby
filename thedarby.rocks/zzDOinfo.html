  <h2>Getting started...</h2>
  <p>Below you can read the SuperAdmin (SA) and Administrator passwords that were originally generated for you, we strongly recommend to change those passwords as soon as possible.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>The SuperAdmin (SA) is a special administrative account, this is the only account that can create and manage virtual servers, as well as create and manage all Administrators.</p>
  <p>URL to connect as SuperAdmin from localhost: <b><a href="https://127.0.0.1:4443/go/" target="_blank">https://127.0.0.1:4443/go/</a></b></p>
  <p>URL to connect as SuperAdmin from the Internet: <b><a href="https://24.20.143.236:4443/go/" target="_blank">https://24.20.143.236:4443/go/</a></b></p>
  <p>SuperAdmin password: <b>FB6TXOMASLOEXMYROFY4HUCSXA</b></p>
  <br/>
  <p>Your first virtual server (default) was already created for you. In order to manage and configure it you will need to connect as an Administrator. Your first Administrator account for this virtual server was already created, and you can find its login information here below.</p>
  <p>URL to connect as Administrator from localhost: <b><a href="https://127.0.0.1:4443/go-default/" target="_blank">https://127.0.0.1:4443/go-default/</a></b></p>
  <p>URL to connect as Administrator from the Internet: <b><a href="https://24.20.143.236:4443/go-default/" target="_blank">https://24.20.143.236:4443/go-default/</a></b></p>
  <p>Administrator username: <b>admin</b></p>
  <p>Administrator password: <b>FB6TXOMASLOEXMYROFY4HUCSXA</b></p>
  <br/>
  <p>We have also already created your first SFTP user, currently associated with a Virtual File System (VFS) rooted into <b>C:\DefaultRoot\</b>. Feel free to change it and/or add more VFSs and user accounts. Below you can read the username and password of this first "demo" user account.</p>
  <p>Username: <b>defaultuser</b></p>
  <p>Password: <b>ZBQQ2MWAVMLUFBRUJGHASQDTPI</b></p>
  <p>Can connect over: <b>SFTP, FTPS, FTPES</b> (plain unencrypted FTP is not currently enabled for this account)</p>
